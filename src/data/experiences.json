        "description": "Nexford is a global online-only university. I joined as the second and most senior product hire after they raised their Series A round and have been instrumental in growing active learners by more than 50% in 12 months. I was the PM for a cross-functional scrum team which launched myNXU, a portal for learners to manage their programs and make payments which helped reduce support tickets per customer by 4.5x over 6 months. I Headed up the Learner Success 2.0 initiative which, thanks to efforts across multiple departments, saw Academic Start Rate (activation) rise from 70% to 92% in 6 months. Together with the data scientist we created a machine-learning backed outreach system which helped increase Academic Start Rate and saved over 100 hours of Success Advisor time per month. I mentored the Junior Product Manager, providing regular coaching and focus areas. I modelled active learner growth numbers and pivoted the whole organisation to focus on increasing acquisition rather than activation and retention. I took on data analyst responsibilities when the data scientist left providing data and analysis to the senior management team."
