Rarely are we left with furrowed brows wondering whether to go to the cinema or go to work. Or whether to write that documentation or go for a run. Those examples may seem silly but they illustrate the way we have solved the prioritisation problem. In our day-to-day lives we never try to prioritise between dissimilar things. We divide our time into buckets (work, sleep, entertainment, chores, self-care etc.), decide how much time we want to dedicate to each and then only prioritise within a bucket, making the prioritisation trivial. We only have to decide between seeing friends and watching Netflix or running versus lifting weights and never between doing the washing up and brushing our teeth. ",
